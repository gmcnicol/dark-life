# Task 014 — CI Smoke Tests for A/V Integrity

Objective: Automatically verify a small end-to-end render produces both audio and video streams.

Implementation Steps
- [ ] Provide fixture: short text → TTS (mock or cached) → create frames (5 PNGs) in temp.
- [ ] Run renderer on the fixture job; output to temp output dir.
- [ ] Validate with ffprobe: has one video stream (h264) and one audio stream (aac); duration > 0.
- [ ] Ensure cleanup at end.

Tests
- [ ] CI job executes smoke test on PRs affecting renderer.
- [ ] On failure, attach ffmpeg stderr snippet as artifact.

Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] CI fails if audio or video is missing; success proves both present and non-zero duration.
