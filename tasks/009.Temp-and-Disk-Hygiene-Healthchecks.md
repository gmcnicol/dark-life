# Task 009 â€” Temp/Disk Hygiene & Healthchecks

Objective: Avoid disk bloat and add service health signals.

Implementation Steps
- [ ] Per-job temp: {TMP_DIR}/{job_id}; cleanup on success and on error.
- [ ] Preflight disk: refuse when free space < 2 GB; log totals (df -h when DEBUG).
- [ ] Docker healthcheck: simple script hitting API ping + worker readiness (recent heartbeat or startup complete).

Tests
- [ ] Integration: simulated low-disk triggers refusal with clear logs.
- [ ] On error path, temp dir is removed.
- [ ] Healthcheck returns 0 when ready; non-zero when API unreachable.

Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] No leftover temp dirs after runs; healthcheck green in compose.
