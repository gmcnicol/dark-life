# Task 012 — Story Splitting Validation (Server-Side)

Objective: Enforce well-formed parts with duration targets and sentence alignment.

Rules
- Target 45–60s per part; min 30s, max 75s.
- Store start_char/end_char offsets; sentence boundary snap where possible.

Implementation Steps
- [ ] Server endpoint validates parts; rejects out-of-bounds with hints.
- [ ] Preview endpoint returns estimated durations (chars→seconds heuristic).
- [ ] Immutable creation timestamp and ordered indices; replace-all update supported.

Tests
- [ ] Unit: boundary snapping & duration estimator.
- [ ] Integration: invalid parts rejected with actionable error JSON.
- [ ] Round-trip: replace-all preserves order and indices.

Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Saved parts obey constraints; invalid submissions rejected with clear messages.
