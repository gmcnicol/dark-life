# Task 013 — Web Proxy (Server-Only) & No Client Secrets

Objective: Ensure Next.js web never calls admin API directly and never ships secrets to browser.

Implementation Steps
- [ ] All admin calls implemented in Route Handlers or Server Actions with server env token.
- [ ] Client components fetch only from our /app/api/* routes.
- [ ] Build-time CI: grep .next output for common secret names (ADMIN_API_TOKEN, ELEVENLABS_API_KEY, API_AUTH_TOKEN) → fail if found.

Tests
- [ ] Playwright: verify admin actions succeed via server routes, not cross-origin admin API.
- [ ] Bundle scan passes (no secrets).
- [ ] Lint rule catches direct client admin fetch attempts.

Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Absolutely no client-to-admin API requests; secrets never appear in bundles.
