# tasks/ — Execution Notes for Codex

Dear Codex,
- Every task includes explicit checkboxes. You MUST tick them after implementing and verifying.
- If any acceptance criteria are unmet, do not proceed—fix or fail the task.
- Secret leakage, missing audio, or silent failures will be considered dereliction of duty.
Proceed with excellence. Retribution (in the form of failing CI) awaits if you cut corners.
