# Task 010 â€” Docker Compose Polish

Objective: Ensure renderer runs chatty by default, with correct mounts and log rotation.

Implementation Steps
- [ ] Set service command to call worker runner with unbuffered Python and absolute paths.
- [ ] Volumes: ./content:/content:ro, ./output:/output (rw), optional ./content/tts_cache:/content/tts_cache.
- [ ] Logging driver: json-file with rotation (max-size: 10m, max-file: 3).
- [ ] Healthcheck as per Task 009.
- [ ] Profiles: allow --profile renderer to run just the worker.

Tests
- [ ] docker compose ... up renderer prints logs immediately.
- [ ] logs -f --tail=0 renderer shows heartbeats.
- [ ] Restart preserves mounts and outputs to host /output.

Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] One command brings up a talkative renderer; logs rotate; mounts are correct.
